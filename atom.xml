  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In the past four months, everything in my life has changed drastically. I graduated college, started working as a software engineer, and for the first time in several years have found myself with plenty of free time. For over half a year I&rsquo;ve had the intention of remodeling my site, but found an excuse to put it off. Given the recent changes in my life, I figured now is the perfect time to do some spring cleaning and bring back life to this site. Today you&rsquo;re seeing that in this new layout.
<br><br>
You may remember my old site. It was my first time creating any website. My lack of creativity however, and limited knowledge led to a rather empty looking website however:</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/oldWebsite.png" alt="oldWebsite" /></p>

<blockquote><p>I did however experiment a lot with it, although from a viewing standpoint it was an extremely boring site&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new?</p>

<p>-For the first time I&rsquo;ll be using Jekyll on this site.</p>

<p>-The blog page will include blogs for the first time!</p>

<p>-There will no longer be an About page. Instead I will be including my resume.</p>
