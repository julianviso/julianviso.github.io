  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>A couple days ago I received my yearly notification to renew my domain. Each year when this happens, I tend to update this website. It has been about a year since this website was last updated. Yes I realize that I claimed last year I would try using the blog that I&rsquo;ve created. A lot has happened in the past year such as the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>I started my professional career.</li>
<li>I became really comfortable with Android.</li>
<li>I did my first ever solo travel. I went to San Francisco to visit one of my college roommates.</li>
<li>I purchased my first bike, and picked it up as a new hobby (which I might add was highlighted when I went biking across the Golden Gate in my trip to SF).</li>
<li>I picked up playing volleyball.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were many other things that happened throughout the year, however at the time of this writing, it was what first came to my mind. When I tried to finally update this website however, I realized that I had completely forgotten how to generate this site using jekyll. After some struggles figuring re-learning jekyll and how to generate everything in my site again, I decided now would be a great time for a blog post to document how to do this for the future if I ever forget again.</p>

<p>My website has two repositories on github.</p>

<ul>
<li>julianviso.github.io</li>
<li>jvsite</li>
</ul>


<p>It was created to where any content I manually create (such as this blog post) gets written in jvsite, and then all the content gets generated in julianviso.github.io which is then displayed. To do this, the following command is run.</p>

<pre><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre>

<p>This command will generate everything inside of _site. Everything that gets generated in here then needs to be pushed to julianviso.github.io in order for the changes to show up. To do this we can either manually move everything over (bad idea) or we can let jekyll do everything for us with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>jekyll build --destination "path to julianviso.github.io"
</code></pre>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In the past four months, everything in my life has changed drastically. I graduated college, started working as a software engineer, and for the first time in several years have found myself with plenty of free time. For over half a year I&rsquo;ve had the intention of remodeling my site, but found an excuse to put it off. Given the recent changes in my life, I figured now is the perfect time to do some spring cleaning and bring back life to this site. Today you&rsquo;re seeing that in this new layout that was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/biomadeira/sustain">Sustain</a>.
<br><br>
You may remember my old site. It was my first time creating any website. My lack of creativity however, and limited knowledge led to a rather empty looking website however:</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/oldWebsite.png" alt="oldWebsite" /></p>

<blockquote><p>I did however experiment a lot with it, although from a viewing standpoint it was an extremely boring site&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new?</p>

<p>-For the first time I&rsquo;ll be using Jekyll on this site.</p>

<p>-The blog page will include blogs for the first time!</p>

<p>-There will no longer be an About page. Instead I will be including my resume.</p>
